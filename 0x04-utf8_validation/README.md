# UTF-8 Validation Project

## Overview

This project involves writing a method to determine if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding used for electronic communication, and it can encode all possible characters in Unicode. The validation requires knowledge of bitwise operations, the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming.

## Requirements

- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Python Version**: 3.4.3
- **PEP 8**: Your code should conform to PEP 8 style guidelines (version 1.7.x)
- **Execution**: All files must be executable
